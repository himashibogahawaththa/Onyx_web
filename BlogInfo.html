		<p>Beryl may contain significant amounts of water at the channel sites. When heated above 400 degrees, the trapped water breaks into gaseous molecules that are confined to the channel voids. The channel water is liberated at temperatures of about 800 degrees, without much effect on the natural ratio of hydrogen isotopes. Thus, channel water may represent the original fluid composition from the time of formation, and the measurement of the change in ratio of hydrogen isotopes in water released from beryl may permit determination of the source of the fluids from which the beryl grew.<br><br>

		Isotopic compositions of historical emerald artifacts have been used to show that during historical times, artisans worked with emeralds originating from deposits that were supposedly discovered only in the 20th century. Research by Gaston Giuliani and his colleagues at the Center for Petrographical and Geochemical Research in France found that most of the high-quality emeralds cut in the 18th century in India were transported there from Colombia, whereas previous studies had assumed a closer origin.<br><br>

		Beryl and chrysoberyl (described in the following section) are relatively rare because there is very little beryllium in the upper continental crust. Beryllium tends to be concentrated in rocks such as granites, pegmatites (formed from water-rich magmas) and black shales (a sedimentary rock), as well as rocks that these materials can metamorphose into. Chromium and vanadium are more common in the upper continental crust and are concentrated in igneous rocks such as peridotites, dunites (a type of peridotite) and basalts (quickly cooled magma) of the oceanic crust and upper mantle and their metamorphic equivalents. However, high concentrations of chromium and vanadium can also occur in sedimentary rocks, particularly black shales. , pegmatites (formed from water-rich magmas) and black shales (a sedimentary rock), as well as rocks that these materials can metamorphose into. Chromium and vanadium are more common in the upper continental crust and are concentrated in igneous rocks such as peridotites.</p>
